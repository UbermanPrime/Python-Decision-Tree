Decision Tree Based Machine Learning Algorithm Written in Python

The repository contains my self implemented decision tree and random forest algorithms, which serves for the purpose of leanring machine learning adn Python (Numpy & Pandas) programming.

The implementation of decision tree references the materials from Udacity ud262 course
(https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262).
